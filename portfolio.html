		<div>Ivan Pavlov was a Russian scientist who lived from 1849 to 1935. He did years of study on digestion in dogs, through creating an exteriorized portion of the dogs stomach. He later studied exteriorized salivary glands in both dogs and humans. Through studying salivary glands, he noticed how dogs would begin to salivate at the thought of it being time to eat, which he called “psychic secretion” - a characteristic of inherent Respondent behavior. His investigation into this gave birth to his famous experiment of ringing a bell before feeding dogs, which caused them to salivate at the sound of the bell without the scent of food being in the air. This was the beginning of Classical Conditioning, which showed how a reaction that would normally take place from one type of stimulus (food/salivation) can be created with an unrelated stimulus that becomes associated (bell ringing/food.)</div>
		<div>Edward Thorndike was a Massachusettes born psychologist who lived from 1874 to 1949. His theories of Behaviorism focused on Operant behavior - the idea that behavior is the result of consequences of the environment, rather than Pavlov’s inherent behaviors to certain stimuli. He outlined the Law of Effect, that a consequence that reinforces or punishes will create likely predictable responses. The Law of Effect is sometimes compared to the idea of natural selection, where certain individual traits will persist due to environmental factors.

		<div>Alburt Bandura is one of the most well known living psychologists. Born in Canada in 1925, his Social Learning Theory is a transition from traditional behaviorist theory to Cognitive theory. His Idea of Social Learning Theory explains that learning can be a social experience, and that individuals learn behaviors through the observation of others. In this case, the learner does not have to directly experience the stimulus, so much as observe the actions and consequences of others.
</div>
		<div>John B. Watson was well known for his conditioning of rats to navigate through a maze to find a food reward at the end. Each time the rats would go through the maze they would do so more quickly and confidently. He would then alter the maze to be shorter - which would cause rats to run into walls - or longer, which would cause the rats to stop at the place the food would normally be, and not notice the reward farther down the hall. He also was known for his experiments on Little Albert, an infant who he was able to create a phobia of rats in, by associating rats with loud noises that would cause the infant to cry. He argued that introspection and consiousness could not be studied, and that the focus of psychology should not be on studying the mind, so much as individual behaviors.

		<div>B. F. Skinner, born in Pennsylvania in 1904, is one of the 20th Centuries most well known and prolific psychologists. He believed that animal and human reaction is exclusively based on stimulus, and that there is no true free will to that effect. He combined the idea of Respondents and Operants, and believed that our behavior is determined by our knowledge of consequences. He also believed in conditioning through introducting multiple stimuli, such as a light that goes on, letting you know a lever can be pressed, which then dispenses a reward. He referred to this as positive reinforcement, and noted that negative reinforcement was equally effective, but did not necessarily have to be punishment. The behavior of carrying a coat on what may be a cold day to prevent freezing falls into his definition of negative reinforcement.

Childhood: I remember as a child my mother insisting that I learn to type. She had been a secretary for years, and said that typing was a skill that everyone would need to have in the future. So she sat me down at our typewriter, and later at a computer using early versions of Mavis Beacon teaches typing. She also found a computer game similar to missile command where you would type words to shoot them down. (As an adult I hunted down a similar game, and Arcade Typing Tutor is fantastic.) I learned it because my mother insisted, but it was entirely hands on, and fun.

Young Adult: In college I was taking several jazz harmony courses, which focused on the mathematics behind creating the music. I was in a 210 level course, and had just skated by in level 201. At one point in the class I was very lost, and when the teacher - asked if everyone was good, I explained that I wasn't. I had felt that I missed something in the 201 course. Dan took a moment to use a few different analogies and examples to explain the practical use and the why behind the subject, and everything clicked into place for me. This was a required learning subject, but I was studying music because I wanted to, so it was a mixture of things I wanted to learn and other's I wouldn't have chosen myself.

Professional Development: I was in California studying how to provide one on one technical training to adults. In this course, the facilitator, an in-house corporate trainer, answered none of my questions and turned everyone back on me as another question. I became exceptionally frustrated with his use of the socratic method - even commenting on Socrates less than honorable demise. That frustration lead me to believe that I wouldn't find someone who'd be willing to give me answers, and I'd need to go out and find them myself. I was learning this to better support my job, which I loved. I couldn't see it at the time, but years later, my ability to find the answers I need is a strong suit, and I have a great love and respect for the efficacy of discovery-based learning.</div>
